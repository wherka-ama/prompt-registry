3. **Browse** — Click "MARKETPLACE" in the Prompt Registry sidebar
4. **Install** — Click any bundle tile, then click **Install**

## 🤖 Ask Copilot About Prompt Registry

Prompt Registry ships with a built-in **Copilot skill** that lets you ask GitHub Copilot questions about the extension directly in chat. No extra setup is required — the skill is available as soon as the extension is installed.

**What you can ask:**
- **Users** — "How do I add a local source?", "What scopes are available?", "Why isn't my hub showing?"
- **Authors** — "How do I create a collection?", "What fields are required in a manifest?", "How do I publish to a hub?"

The skill answers from the extension's own documentation, so responses are always grounded in the actual behavior of your installed version.

> **Note:** The skill covers user and author topics only. For contributor questions (architecture, testing, internals), consult the [Contributor Guide](./docs/contributor-guide/development-setup.md) directly.

> **Seeing incorrect or unexpected answers?** Please [open an issue](https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/prompt-registry/issues) describing the question you asked and the response you received, or reach out to one of the project contributors directly.
