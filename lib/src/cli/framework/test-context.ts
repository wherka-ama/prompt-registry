/**
 * Phase 2 / Iter 1 — In-memory Context factory for golden tests.
 *
 * `createTestContext()` builds a Context whose IO surfaces are entirely
 * in-memory:
 *   - stdout/stderr are captured into a string buffer for assertion;
 *   - exit() records the code without terminating the process;
 *   - clock is manually advanceable for cache-TTL/retry-backoff tests;
 *   - env defaults to {} so tests cannot accidentally leak ambient state;
 *   - cwd defaults to "/" so tests cannot depend on host filesystem layout.
 *
 * fs and net are intentionally stubbed in iter 1 (any call throws). Iter 2
 * wires them to memfs (fs) and undici MockAgent (net). Keeping iter 1 free
 * of those deps keeps the merge tight and avoids a long install step.
 *
 * Test ergonomics (golden-test runner, iter 7) builds on this factory.
 *
 * Note on style: this module deliberately uses arrow-function factories
 * rather than ES classes. The repo eslint config prefers arrow-function
 * shapes over class methods (`prefer-arrow/prefer-arrow-functions`) and
 * requires explicit accessibility modifiers on every class member, which
 * adds noise to what is essentially a struct-of-closures.
