/**
 * Phase 3 / Iter 5 — Domain Layer · Hub types.
 *
 * `HubSourceSpec` is the parsed-config representation of a hub source —
 * a GitHub repo plus type-specific metadata (collections path, plugins
 * path, raw config bag for forward-compat). It is consumed across
 * multiple feature-layer modules (`hub-harvester`, `github-bundle-provider`,
 * `plugin-bundle-provider`, `extra-source`, `cli`) so it satisfies the
 * "≥2 consumers" rule from `lib/src/domain/README.md`.
 *
 * The companion parsing helpers (`parseHubConfig`, `normalizeRepoFromUrl`,
 * `parseExtraSource`) stay in `lib/src/primitive-index/hub/` for now.
 * They depend on `js-yaml` and on URL/string parsing that is feature-IO
 * code, not a shared shape; promoting them would force `domain/` to grow
 * a runtime dependency graph for the first time. They will move only if
 * a second feature-layer consumer needs them.
 *
 * Iter 1 created an aspirational 3-field shape (`{owner, repo, branch?}`)
 * that did not match the real 9-field shape; iter 3 removed it as dead
 * code. Iter 5 introduces the *real* shape, mirroring what the codebase
 * actually uses.
