# Profiles and Hubs

## Profiles

A **Profile** groups bundles from multiple sources. Activate with one click.

### Commands

- **Create**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Prompt Registry: Create Profile"
- **Activate**: Right-click profile → Activate Profile
- **Deactivate**: Right-click active profile → Deactivate Profile

### Views

- **Shared Profiles** — Full catalog from hubs
- **Favorites** — Your curated list + local profiles

Toggle with ⭐ button in Registry Explorer.

## Hubs

A **Hub** is a centralized repository of versioned profiles and sources. Share across your organization.

### First-Run Hub Selection

On first launch, Prompt Registry offers a hub selection dialog:

1. **Pre-configured Hubs** — Default hubs are verified for availability before being shown
2. **Custom Hub URL** — Import from any URL
3. **Skip** — Configure later via commands

When you select a hub:
- Hub is imported and set as active
- All sources from the hub are automatically synced
- First available profile is auto-activated
- Tree view refreshes to show hub content

### Automatic Source Addition

On first run, the extension automatically adds the **Awesome Copilot** source (`github/awesome-copilot`) as a default source. This ensures you have immediate access to community collections.

### Auto-Sync on Startup

Each time VS Code starts, the active hub is automatically synchronized:
- Hub configuration is refreshed from its source
- All sources are synced for latest bundles
- Tree view updates with current state

### Commands

- **Import**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Prompt Registry: Import Hub"
- **Export**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Prompt Registry: Export Hub Configuration"
- **Sync**: Right-click hub → Sync Hub
- **Reset First Run**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Prompt Registry: Reset First Run" (re-triggers hub selector)
